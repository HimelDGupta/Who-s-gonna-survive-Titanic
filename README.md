# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, using machine learning models. By analyzing passenger data, such as age, sex, passenger class, and others, we build a predictive model to estimate survival outcomes. This endeavor not only provides insights into the tragic event but also showcases the power of machine learning in historical data analysis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploration of the Titanic dataset.
- Implementation of various machine learning models.
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance.
- Feature importance analysis to understand the factors affecting survival.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
